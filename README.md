 # There are many factors that face the developer and do a slow harm on his project,  such as :

   # *  Introducing a new bug by fixing another one.
   # * Implementing code that is unnecessary. 
   # * Impossible to add a new feature because of complicated code.

## we should embrace the fundamental laws to avoid these problems. 
 ### The key points that every developer must have are:

   1.He should understand the purpose.

   2. He should understand the goals of SW design , the design should be easy for us and helpful for others.

   3. He should improve his design skills and to be sure that he fully understands the systems and tools that is  working with.

   4.  A good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that it’s really easy to shake out all the bugs. 

  5. Controlling complexity is the essence of computer program ,The source of many software failures is complexity, so the main purpose for each developer is to control complexity, not to create it.

   6. Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development because there will always be some implementation of changes. simplicity and complexity are the two main factors that affect code maintenance. It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance.

  7. Consistency ,Consistency is a big part of simplicity. If we do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place.Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand. 

 8. Prioritizing ,When we talk  about decisions there are three important factors that will help to make a better decision. This equation is explained very well in the Code Simplicity book:
   * The desirability of a change (D)
   * The value of a change (V)
   * The effort required to perform the change (E)

 9. Solving Problems ,The first step is understanding. Know exactly what is being asked. 

 10. Good enough is fine ,Sometimes developers want the first version to be perfect. They don’t focus on the problem they will solve and how their software will help people They start by thinking of every small detail and put assumptions and predictions come along followed by “What if” sentences , so that will make them writing  a code that isn’t needed ,will increase complexity by adding unnecessary codes and be too generic.they should start small part, improve it, then extend to the others. 

11. Predictions ,When developer make predictions, he is being too generic and that is involves a lot of code that isn’t needed.

 12. Assumptions ,What is the assumption? “An assumption is something that you accept as true or supposed to be true, although you have no conclusive proof. One of the great killers of a software project is assumptions. Let’s see how an assumption can kill a software project.Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future. 


13. Stop Reinventing for example, if you invent your own garbage collector when a perfectly good one exists, you’re going to be spending a lot of time working on the garbage collector, when you could just be working on your software ,Don’t reinvent the wheel.

14. Resistance As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be “NO’’.Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them. Because unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software
 15. Automation ,Developer shouldn’t spend time on repetitive tasks. Set them up and forget about them. They can work while they are sleeping. When they realize that,  they are doing something again and again, just remember this :If you can automate it, automate it.

16. Code measurement The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.

*17. Productivity ,Developer main goal should be keeping his code base as small as possible.

18. Testing ,Developer should be reliable. When other developers in the team see that he committed new code to source control, everyone should know that his code is tested, and works.Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.

19. (Under)Estimationdeveloper should break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. he probably still going to get it wrong, but he’ll be a lot less wrong than if he estimated a big project.

20. Running Away from Rewriting Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases.Refactoring should be the first option.

21. Documentation and Commenting developers add comments that say what code is doing.When he can’t make the code simpler then he should add the comment to explain this complexity.The real purpose of comments is to explain “WHY” we did something, not “WHAT” the code is doing.


22. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)Developer shouldn’t depend on external technologies. But when he have to do so, he must try to reduce dependency on them as much as he can because they are another common source of complexity. They can kill his active development and make everything even harder

23. Self-Development Keep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools, read books on software development. They will give you another perspective.

24. Don’t be a heroA lot of times it’s better to be a quitter than a hero .Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.

25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help ,When you have something to implement and you are not sure about the solutions, or when you can’t think of anything on your own, search and don’t ask Find answers and try them out.
